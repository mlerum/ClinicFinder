# ClinicFinder

ClinicFinder is a user-driven platform that allows users to search by state for information on any remaining abortion clinic in the United States.

ClinicFinder was conceived, engineered, and designed by Maddie Lerum as a student project for Hackbright Academy's 12-week software engineering fellowship.
